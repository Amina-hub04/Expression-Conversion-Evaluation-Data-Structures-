# Expression-Conversion-Evaluation-Data-Structures-
A C++ console-based program that converts mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix notation and evaluates them using stack operations. This project demonstrates proficiency in algorithm design, computational logic, and the stack data structure to handle expression parsing and evaluation.
 Features:
Infix to Postfix Conversion – Implements the Shunting Yard algorithm for accurate conversion.
Postfix Evaluation – Uses stack-based computation for efficient results.
Operator Precedence Handling – Supports +, -, *, /, and parentheses.
Error Handling – Detects invalid expressions.
User-Friendly Interface – Simple command-line interaction.
Technologies Used:
C++
Stack (Data Structure)
Algorithm Design
Computational Logic
