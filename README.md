# Expression-Conversion-Evaluation-Data-Structures-
A C++ console-based program that converts mathematical expressions from infix notation to postfix notation and evaluates them using stack operations. This project demonstrates proficiency in algorithm design, computational logic, and the stack data structure to handle expression parsing and evaluation.
